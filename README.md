# MinecraftSkins
Please note that some skins have a bug on the right leg causing the texture to become transparent. The solution is to add a new structure or modify the structure in position.json. Since position.json is incomplete, you can add new attributes. If you can help with a pull request to contribute, that would be great, as I'm a bit lazy. Thank you!

## Next plan (possibly)
I will transform this concept into a website, converting Python into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Below is an illustration of how I plan to turn this into a website

## Update (15/7/2024)
I have added a "change body" feature, which allows you to change your skin and transfer the head to a new body. I manually added instead of using position.json because I was too lazy haha
