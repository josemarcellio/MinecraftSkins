# MinecraftSkins
Please note that some skins have a bug on the right leg causing the texture to become transparent. The solution is to add a new structure or modify the structure in position.json. Since position.json is incomplete, you can add new attributes. If you can help with a pull request to contribute, that would be great, as I'm a bit lazy. Thank you!

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**

   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - For MacOS:
     ```bash
     python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the application:**


   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

   - For macOS:
     ```bash
     python3 app.py
     ```

## Next plan (possibly)
I will transform this concept into a website, converting Python into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Below is an illustration of how I plan to turn this into a website
